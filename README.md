# BenBot: A GPT3 Powered Discord Chatbot

This is a Discord bot that uses the OpenAI API to generate responses to user messages. It also has functionality to remember information about users and provide context to its responses based on past conversations.

## Requirements

-   A Discord account and a Discord server to use the bot on
-   An OpenAI API key
-   The following Python packages:
    -   `os`
    -   `openai`
    -   `random`
    -   `json`
    -   `discord`
    -   `dotenv`

## Setup

1.  Clone the repository and navigate to the directory.
2.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
    -   `DISCORD_TOKEN`: Your Discord bot token
    -   `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
3.  Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4.  Run the script with `python AdvancedBenBot.py`.

## Usage

To use the bot, simply send it a message in a Discord server where it is present. The bot will respond with a message generated by the OpenAI API.

The bot also has the following commands:

-   `!memory`: The bot will provide context for its response based on past conversations with the user.
-   `!ltmemory`: The bot will provide information about the user that it has learned over time.

## Code structure

The code consists of the following functions:

-   `OpinionLookup`: Given a message, this function looks up the bot's opinions on users mentioned in the message.
-   `PersonalHistoryWrite`: Given a user's message and the bot's response, this function writes the conversation to a file specific to the user.
-   `PersonalHistoryRead`: Given a user, this function reads the user's conversation history with the bot.
-   `ReadMemory`: This function reads the bot's overall memory of users' opinions.
-   `WriteMemory`: Given an updated memory, this function writes the memory to a file.
-   `readLtMemory`: Given a user, this function reads the bot's long-term memory of the user.
-   `appendLtMemory`: Given a message, this function updates the bot's long-term memory of a user.

The script also contains code for connecting the bot to Discord and handling messages.

## Customization

You can customize the bot's behavior by modifying the code or by providing your own data files.

### Providing your own data files

The bot uses the following data files:

-   `EmotionalMemory.json`: This file stores the bot's overall memory of users' opinions. You can provide your own file to give the bot a different starting memory.
-   `memories/`: This directory contains files with conversation histories between the bot and individual users. You can provide your own files to give the bot a different starting memory for specific users.
-   `Ltmemories/`: This directory contains files with the bot's long-term memories of individual users. You can provide your own files to give the bot a different starting memory for specific users.

## Limitations

The bot's responses are generated by the OpenAI API, which means that the quality of the responses may vary. In some cases, the responses may not be relevant or coherent.

The bot's memory functions rely on text files to store data. This means that the bot's memory is limited to the information that is written to these files and may not accurately reflect the entire context of past conversations.

## Future work

Some potential ideas for improving the bot include:

-   Improving the quality of the responses by using a larger or more specialized language model.
-   Adding more memory-related functions, such as the ability to search for specific conversations or topics.
-   Integrating the bot with a natural language processing library to better understand and respond to user messages.
-   Adding additional customization options, such as the ability to choose the language or tone of the bot's responses.
